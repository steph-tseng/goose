# Goose

So this: https://fake-tumblr-goose.netlify.app/ is the link to my (somewhat) finished final project. You are able to browse the content of the website without logging in. This content consists of topics (essentially categories) and the projects (posts) that are sorted into those topics. Please create an account either via email or Facebook/google to access the other features.

Upon logging in, you should notice that there are a couple of new links in the navbar: projects, add new, and profile. More exciting should be the circular icon on the bottom left hand corner that contains an image of a goose with its mouth open. That’s a link to the Honk Chat, which is a place where you can chat with everyone registered to the site. Clicking profile will give you access to a sidebar (accessible via drawer icon in the navbar that has replaced the Goose website logo) where you can see Honk Chat, all users, and the people you’re following.

When you first login, you will be directed to an empty page that will later contain the list of projects from the people you follow. The page will prompt you (with links) to follow people either from the list of all users or the list of all projects. Please try creating a new topic and/or project via the dropdown button or the dropdown menu in the navbar.

Users can:

- login
- create topics
- post projects in topics
- chat
